# 02-advanced-css-portfolio

The purpose of this project was to develop a professional portfolio page that showcases the projects that I have successfully developed. Furthermore, the project contains links to different forms of contact. In this project I created a navigation bar in the header that scrolls to specific sections of the page. Also, the navigation and contact me links change color when hovered over but not when visited. Similarly, the projects images change opacity to clear when hovered over. The page also contains large hero image, about me text, and simple footer. The website is also optimized for phone.
